# DriveBox Update Issue Fix

## Problem Analysis
The original issue was that DriveBox v1.2.2 would detect v1.2.3 available, download it, and restart, but it would still be running v1.2.2 instead of the updated version.

## Root Cause
The update system had a critical flaw: it only **downloaded** the update file but never **installed** it. When the app restarted with `app.relaunch()`, it would restart the same old executable, not the newly downloaded one.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Download Process
- Downloads update to temporary directory
- Tracks download progress with proper speed and ETA calculations
- Stores pending update information in electron-store

### 2. Smart Update Installation
- Creates backup of current executable before update
- Uses a Windows batch script to handle the file replacement process
- The batch script:
  - Waits for the current app to close
  - Replaces the old executable with the new one
  - Starts the updated version
  - Cleans up temporary files and backups

### 3. Robust Error Handling
- If update installation fails, restores from backup
- Automatic cleanup of old backup files (older than 24 hours)
- Cleanup of temporary update files on startup

### 4. Process Flow
```
1. User clicks "Update" → Download starts
2. Progress tracked and displayed to user
3. Update file saved to temp directory + stored in config
4. User clicks "Restart" → Batch script created
5. Batch script executed, current app exits
6. Batch script replaces executable file
7. New version launches automatically
8. Cleanup of temp files and backups
```

## Key Improvements
- ✅ **Actual Installation**: Updates now properly replace the executable
- ✅ **Safe Process**: Backup and restore mechanism prevents corruption
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress with speed/ETA
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes temporary files and old backups
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Falls back to original version if update fails

## Files Modified
- `src/main.js`: Complete rewrite of update system
- `package.json`: Added electron-updater dependency (later removed)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with actual GitHub release having v1.2.4
2. Verify download progress display works correctly
3. Test restart and installation process
4. Verify cleanup functions work properly
5. Test error scenarios (network issues, permission problems)

The update system should now work correctly and properly upgrade from v1.2.2 to v1.2.3 (or any newer version) when available.
